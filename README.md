This is the public GitHub project that you can contribute to.
If you are just getting started, I suggest you start at the tutorial here: https://www.w3schools.com/git

# Leave a message for us!
This repository is meant to be a place where our users can leave messages for others to see.

You can see the result here: https://w3schools-test.github.io/

We generally only have one condition: 
We will not allow messages that are negative, or hurtful. Try to be welcome and positive!

# What should my message look like?

You can add almost anything to the index.html file between the indicated comments:

`<!-- Insert your message below here -->`

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<title>W3.CSS</title>
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/4/w3.css">
<body>

<div class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-sand">
    <p class="w3-xxlarge w3-serif"><i>"My love for w3schools.com is unlimited, it has been a helping hand for me right from beginning Thanks for all you do. You are the best."</i></p>
    <h2>Hammed Bello from Nigeria</h2>
</div>


</body>
</html>


`<!-- End user messages -->`

So feel free to use your imagination!

If you are not feeling very creative, you can add a quote, or small text like the examples on this page: https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_quotes.asp
And add your name to it :)
