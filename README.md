# Guestbook for w3schools.com Git tutorial

This is the public GitHub project that I,** <font color="purple">Pirikli</font>**, am contributing to.
If you are just getting started, I suggest you start at the tutorial here: https://www.w3schools.com/git

# Leave a message for us!
This repository is meant to be a place where our users can leave messages for others to see.

You can see the result here: https://w3schools-test.github.io/

We generally only have one condition: 
We will not allow messages that are negative, or hurtful. Try to be welcome and positive!

# What should my message look like?

You can add almost anything to the index.html file between the indicated comments:

# <font color="green">Hellow World!</font>
## I am <font color="purple">Pirikli</font>, a **poet and storyteller** who loves creation!
### I hear you ask: why a poet is learning Git and GitHub?!
>> The answer is here: https://github.com/pirikli

and

`<!-- End user messages -->`

So feel free to use your imagination!

If you are not feeling very creative, you can add a quote, or small text like the examples on this page: https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_quotes.asp
And add your name to it :)

We reserve the right to remove, or not to add anything that we feel will not fit here.
Also, this page is a community page, and the content you add may be changed later.
